# pi_overkill 0.3.0
Â© Copyright 2020 JonLiuFYI

Discover the value of pi the long way. Fun fact: the probability of two random positive integers being coprime is `6 / pi^2`.

Made in Rust.

## Requirements
* `rust` and `cargo`
* Crates listed in `Cargo.toml` will be downloaded during the build process

## Usage
1. In a terminal, go to this repository's directory.
2. Run `cargo build --release` to build the program.
3. Run `./pi_overkill --help` to see what to do.

Try running it multiple times to see how the guess varies, or `time` it to see how long it takes!

## Changelog
### 0.3.0
* Added argument parsing using `clap`
  * `-i` or `--iters` to specify how many iterations per thread
  * `-t` or `--threads` to specify how many threads to run

### 0.2.2
* Removed an unnecessary instance of cloning the Sender

### 0.2.1
* Fixed off-by-one error that made one too many Senders
* Display more information about the pi estimate
  * Total iterations
  * Number of threads
  * Percentage error relative to Rust's builtin `std::f64::consts::PI`

### 0.2
* Added multithreading with message passing, but it's hardcoded
  * Enjoy running 12 threads with 4 million iterations each
